In this course, I built a CRUD Python module to connect to MongoDB, then used it in Project Two to power an interactive dashboard. Writing the database functions in a separate module made the code easier to manage and reuse. It kept everything organized and let me focus on building the dashboard without repeating work. I could definitely use the same module for other apps that use the same data. When solving problems, I broke things down into smaller parts and focused on one feature at a time. This project felt more like real-world work, since I had to think about what the user needs and how to make the data useful. I will keep using this approach in future projects, especially when working with clients or building tools that use databases. Projects like this show what computer scientists actually do. We build systems that organize data and make it easier for others to get useful info. A company like Grazioso Salvare can use a tool like this to track animals and make faster decisions, which helps them work better.
